Here is Just to test a simple page application and see how it works

You can test to see how it works from your end

Clone the repo from my github account

I use Vanilla/plain JavaScript to make it work

To test this

from command prompt


Start a node server from the cli using node server

The port here is set to 5000

Then use localhost:5000 in the url to see navigations
